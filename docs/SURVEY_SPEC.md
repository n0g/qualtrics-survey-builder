# Markdown Survey Specification

This document defines the markdown format accepted by `convert.py`.

---

## File Structure

```
---
title: My Survey Title
language: EN
description: Optional description
---

# Block Name

## Question text [type]
- Choice 1
- Choice 2

---

# Another Block

## Another question [type]
```

---

## Frontmatter

YAML block at the top of the file (required for title, optional otherwise).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `title` | `Untitled Survey` | Survey name shown in Qualtrics |
| `language` | `EN` | Language code |
| `description` | `""` | Survey description (metadata only) |

---

## Blocks

Level-1 headings (`#`) define blocks (pages in Qualtrics). If no `#` headings are used, all questions go into a single default block.

```markdown
# Demographics

## Question 1 [mc]
...

# Feedback

## Question 2 [text]
```

---

## Questions

Level-2 headings (`##`) define questions. The type is specified in `[brackets]` at the end.

```markdown
## Question text here [type]
```

Add `*` after the type to make the question required:

```markdown
## What is your name? [text]*
```

---

## Question Types

### `[mc]` — Multiple Choice, Single Answer

Choices are listed as bullet points.

```markdown
## What is your age? [mc]
- Under 18
- 18–24
- 25–34
- 35–44
- 45 or older
```

### `[mc-multi]` — Multiple Choice, Multiple Answers

```markdown
## Which platforms do you use? [mc-multi]
- iOS
- Android
- Web
- Desktop
```

### `[mc-dropdown]` — Multiple Choice, Dropdown

```markdown
## Select your country [mc-dropdown]
- United States
- Germany
- Japan
- Other
```

### `[text]` — Single-Line Text Entry

No bullet points needed.

```markdown
## What is your email address? [text]
```

### `[text-essay]` — Multi-Line / Essay Text Entry

```markdown
## Please describe your experience [text-essay]
```

### `[matrix]` — Matrix / Likert Scale (single answer per row)

Specify the scale (columns) with a `scale:` line (comma-separated), then list rows as bullet points.

```markdown
## Rate the following features [matrix]
scale: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent
- Ease of use
- Visual design
- Performance
- Documentation
```

### `[matrix-multi]` — Matrix, Multiple Answers per Row

Same syntax as `[matrix]`.

```markdown
## Which of the following apply? [matrix-multi]
scale: Never, Sometimes, Often, Always
- I use the mobile app
- I use the desktop app
- I use the API
```

### `[rank]` — Rank Order (Drag and Drop)

Choices are listed as bullet points. Supports `carry-from:` for dynamic choices.

```markdown
## Rank these concerns from most to least important [rank]
- Financial loss
- Physical safety
- Emotional distress
```

With carry-forward:

```markdown
## Rank the threats you identified from most to least concerning [rank]*
carry-from: QID1
```

---

### `[description]` — Descriptive Text (no input)

The heading is the internal label. Any paragraph text after the heading becomes the displayed body content.

```markdown
## Instructions [description]
Please read the following carefully before proceeding.

All responses are anonymous and will only be used for research purposes.
```

---

## Page Breaks

A `---` line inside a block inserts a page break between questions.

```markdown
# Block 1

## Question 1 [mc]
- Yes
- No

---

## Question 2 [text]
```

---

## Skip Logic

`skip-if:` conditionally skips to another question or ends the block/survey based on an answer. Place it after the choices of an MC question.

```
skip-if: <choice_number> <condition> → <destination>
```

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| `choice_number` | 1-based index of the choice |
| `condition` | `Selected`, `NotSelected`, `Empty`, `NotEmpty` |
| `destination` | `ENDOFBLOCK`, `ENDOFSURVEY`, or `QID<n>` |

Multiple `skip-if:` rules on one question are all applied.

```markdown
## Are you currently subscribed? [mc]*
- Yes
- No
skip-if: 1 Selected → ENDOFBLOCK
```

```markdown
## Have you ever considered using one? [mc]*
- Yes
- No
skip-if: 2 Selected → ENDOFSURVEY
```

---

## Conditional Blocks (Branch Flow)

`branch-if:` on a block (line immediately after `# Block Name`) wraps the entire block in a Branch element in the Qualtrics survey flow. The block is only presented to respondents who match the condition.

```
# Block Name
branch-if: QID<n>/<choice_number> <operator>
```

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| `QID<n>` | Question number in the survey (assigned sequentially, 1-based) |
| `choice_number` | 1-based index of the choice in that question |
| `operator` | `Selected`, `NotSelected` |

```markdown
# Premium Features
branch-if: QID3/1 Selected

## Which premium features do you use? [mc-multi]
- Advanced analytics
- API access
- Priority support
```

**Question numbering:** QIDs are assigned in order of appearance across all blocks (counting description blocks as questions). QID1 is the first question in the first block, QID2 is the second, and so on.

**Labels:** Instead of counting QIDs manually, add `@label` at the end of any question heading and reference it as `@label` anywhere a `QIDn` is expected. Labels are resolved to the correct QID automatically.

```markdown
## Who concerns you? [mc-multi]* @threat_actors
- Scammers
- Stalkers

# Threat Details
loop-from: @threat_actors

# Premium
branch-if: @threat_actors/1 Selected
```

---

## Loop & Merge

`loop-from:` on a block (line immediately after `# Block Name`) configures the block as a Loop & Merge block. The block repeats once for each choice the respondent selected in the source question. Within loop block questions, use `${lm://Field/1}` to pipe in the current choice label.

```
# Block Name
loop-from: QID<n>
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `QID<n>` | Question whose selected choices drive the loop iterations |

```markdown
# Threat Actors
## Who are you concerned might misuse your data? [mc-multi]
- Scammers or fraudsters
- Stalkers or abusive partners
- Identity thieves

# Threat Details
loop-from: QID1

## How do you think ${lm://Field/1} would misuse your data? [mc-multi]
- Phishing or scam attempts
- Locating me physically
- Accessing my financial accounts

## Have you personally experienced ${lm://Field/1} misusing data? [mc]*
- Yes
- No
- I am not sure
```

**Piped text:** `${lm://Field/1}` is replaced at runtime by Qualtrics with the choice label of the current loop iteration. Write it directly in the question text — no extra configuration needed.

**Note:** The source question must be an `[mc-multi]` question. Loop blocks cannot be combined with `branch-if:` in the current implementation.

---

## Carry Forward Choices

`carry-from:` on a question (line immediately after `## Question text [type]`) populates the question's choices dynamically from the selected choices of a prior question. No bullet points are needed — choices are injected at runtime by Qualtrics.

```
## Question text [type]
carry-from: QID<n>
```

```markdown
# Threats
## Who are you concerned about? [mc-multi]*
- Scammers or fraudsters
- Stalkers or abusive partners
- Identity thieves

# Appraisal
## Which of these threats concerns you most? [mc]*
carry-from: QID1
```

Only the choices the respondent actually selected in the source question are shown.

**Note:** The source question must be an `[mc-multi]` question.

---

## Display Logic on Individual Questions

`show-if:` on a question (line immediately after `## Question text [type]`) conditionally shows that question based on a previous answer.

```
## Question text [type]
show-if: QID<n>/<choice_number> <operator>
```

```markdown
## Which premium service did you use? [mc]
show-if: QID2/1 Selected
- Service A
- Service B
```

## Choice Text Entry

Add `[+text]` at the end of a choice to enable an inline text field when that choice is selected. Typically used for "Other — please specify" choices on `[mc]` and `[mc-multi]` questions.

```
- Choice text [+text]
```

Can be combined with `[VARNAME=N]`:

```markdown
## What is your gender? [mc]*
- Man
- Woman
- Non-binary
- Prefer to self-describe [+text]
- Prefer not to say
```

```markdown
## Which platform do you use? [mc-multi]
- iOS
- Android
- Other [OTHER][+text]
```

---

## Recode Values and Variable Naming

Add `[VARNAME]` or `[VARNAME=N]` at the end of a choice or matrix row to assign a variable name and/or a numeric recode value for data export.

```
- Choice text [VARNAME]
- Choice text [VARNAME=N]
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `VARNAME` | All-caps variable name (e.g. `FINANCE`, `PHYSICAL_SAFETY`) |
| `N` | Integer recode value for this choice in exported data |

```markdown
## What kind of harm concerns you? [mc-multi]
- Financial loss [FINANCE=9]
- Risk to physical safety [PHYSICAL=2]
- Emotional distress [EMOTIONAL=3]
- None of the above [NONE=8]
```

---

## Translations

Add `languages:` to the frontmatter and per-question `lang-XX:` lines to provide translations.

```yaml
---
title: My Survey
language: EN
languages: [DE, FR]
---
```

**Question text:**
Place `lang-XX:` immediately after the question heading:

```markdown
## What is your age? [mc]*
lang-de: Wie alt sind Sie?
```

**Choice translations:**
Place `lang-XX:` on the line immediately after the choice:

```markdown
- Under 18
  lang-de: Unter 18 Jahren
- 18–24
  lang-de: 18–24
```

**Matrix scale translations:**
Use `lang-XX-scale:` with a comma-separated list matching the scale length:

```markdown
scale: Strongly Disagree, Neutral, Strongly Agree
lang-de-scale: Stimme gar nicht zu, Neutral, Stimme voll zu
```

**Matrix row translations:**
Same as choices — place `lang-XX:` after each row bullet:

```markdown
- Ease of use
  lang-de: Benutzerfreundlichkeit
- Performance
  lang-de: Leistung
```

Qualtrics will serve the translated version to respondents whose browser/panel language matches.

---

## Limitations

- Branch logic conditions support only a single `QID/choice operator` expression (AND/OR not yet supported)
- Loop blocks cannot be combined with `branch-if:` in the same block
- `[VARNAME]` annotations on matrix rows produce `VariableNaming` entries but Qualtrics may not honor them for matrix questions
- Survey-level metadata (title, description) translations are not yet supported
- Scoring is not supported
- Choice randomization is not supported
- Rich text / HTML in question text is not supported
